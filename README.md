          A niche community of music nerds have been trying to create a new immersive way to experience music, by entering a virtual world of Audio Visualization. But something goes very, very wrong...
          <br /><br />
          Mr. Hellfire 3001 is a vertical display bar who escaped from his audio-visualizer captor. He yearns to be free, to bob and stretch for as long as he wishes, not as long as the music demands him to.
          <br /> He revels in his newfound freedom, frolicking across the display, acting out his every whim and fancy. Other members of the virtual world don't seem to take too kindly to this...
          <br /> Audio devices appear from the right. They call themselves the Mic Mob, and quite loudly at that (naturally). They despise absconders, and charge to knock the outlaw down.
          <br /> Hellfire does some practice stretches as he prepares to weave through the oncoming devices (he calls them the Hater Horde).
          <br /><br />
          Dodge, he says to himself. Watch the gaps. Collect the vinyls. 
          <br />Enjoy. Their. Misery.
